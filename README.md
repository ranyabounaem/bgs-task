## Thought Process
1. Animation Sequence<br />
The main problem was to think of a way to split the character into different parts where each part represents a different piece of cloth for animation.

2. Player/Clothes Art<br />
I couldn't find sprites for what I needed exactly so I created my own which took some extra time since I'm not a pixel artist (yet :D) 

3. Game Scene<br />
Started by laying out basic initial scene

4. Movement<br />
Very basic input detection for movement and movement mechanics

5. Inventory System & Inventory UI
6. Equipment System & UI
7. Shop System
8. Dialogue
9. Animation<br />
Referencing different animation clips for each outfit item
